kOpt: Traveling Salesmen Problem heuristics

jsyang.ca@gmail.com

2-opt and 3-opt operators to solve the sequence of visit locations as to achieve 
the shortest route visiting all locations once. 2-opt operations are less 
computationally expensive than 3-opt, but are granular and thus more likely to 
become stuck in local minima. 

There are also 4-opt operations which haven't been implemented since there's 
assumed to be only 1 actor making this run; will implement these eventually.

Sept. 17, 2010  Original implementation
Apr.   4, 2011	Removed dependency on raphael.js; refactored everything.
                Created a more detailed README.

Object		Description

Loc			Location - predefines some aspect of the distance of the tour.
			Contains a distance function specific to this geometry: Euclidean.

Tour		Essentially a sequence of Locations. The tour distance is a 
			function of its Location visit sequence.
			Can also replace the current sequence if a new sequence has an 
			improved tour distance.

Heuristic	Description
K-Name    

2-SWAP      Swaps the position of 2 locs and reverses the exterior.
3-MOVE      Moves a subsequence within a sequence.
3-SPLIT     Splits a sequence into 2 sequences each carried out in parallel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-Opt: SWAP operation

    Don't just SWAP the two Locations at their indices, since this does nothing
    for the rest of the Tour if you don't reverse the portion that's 
    in/exterior to the segment generated by the bounds of the swap. For example:

       Head                                                                    
     _/_                                  Interior                              
    |   |      Body                     - B - C - D - E -                       
         _____/_____                                                           
        |           |     Tail            Exterior                              
                         /              A -  ..  F -                            
                        |                                                       
        i           j          2-OPT      Interior reversed                     
    A - B - C - D - E - F      ---->    A - E - D - C - B - F                   
                                                                                
                                          Exterior reversed                     
                                        F - B - C - D - E - A                   
                                                                                
    Reversing the order of either of these segments completes the 2-opt,
    after swapping the Locations i, j. Though the direction of the sequence is  
    different in either case, the geometry of the Tour remains the same.
    "Unknotting" is thus accomplished.

3-Opt: MOVE operation

	We attempt to MOVE a subsequence of the Tour to a new position; treating the
	segment as a single location.

    i       Starting index of the segment
    j       Segment length
    shift   Where to shift to the new position
    
    Cut the segment from the old sequence, and build the new sequence by
    adding anything before the start index, the segment and then appending any 
    remaining Locations in the old sequence that weren't in the segment.
